# Further Reading

Once you've exhausted the content I can offer you, I encourage you to keep on
surfing along to some sites I enjoy reading. Some are friends, some are folks I
just appreciate the work of, all are worth some time. You'll find them in
alphabetical order.

- [Dan Luu](http://danluu.com/), who writes long-form articles about being
  better at both technology and at being a human in general, particularly with
  an eye for thoughtfulness to other people.

- [Ed Davies](https://edavies.me.uk), who knows an enormous amount about
  off-grid and/or otherwise alternative living, and about electrical systems
  therein.

- [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co), made up of [Rekka](https://kokorabbit.ca)
  and [Devine](https://xxiivv.com): minimalist sailors, artists, and developers
  of smol tools for smol computers. Strong believers in exploration and fun for
  the sakes of exploration and fun.

- [Jake Bauer aka @jbauer](https://www.paritybit.ca/), who manages to eke out
  more years of life from old computers than I would have thought possible.

- [Joshua Stein aka @jcs](https://jcs.org), a developer of OpenBSD and of
  utilities for classic Macintoshes, among other things.

- [Kyle Brown aka @kdb424](https://blog.kdb424.xyz), a lifelong friend who
  dabbles with 3D printers, hi-fi audio, mechanical keyboards, and is often
  helping ensure I don't sawzall my leg off when doing boat work.

- [Low Tech Magazine (solar edition)](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/),
  exactly what it says on the tin. The site is available only if the
  solar-charged battery can keep the server running, which may particularly be
  of concern during the deepest bits of Northern Hemisphere winter. Try again
  in a few hours if it's down. Trust me, it's worth the wait.

## Bonus: Further Watching

These are all YouTube channels (sorry for the proprietary links), but ones I've
found helpful, inspiring, relaxing, or otherwise worth taking time out of my
day to watch long-form content from. Some of these have content warnings
associated (generally for hunting or fishing), but beyond those factors are
generally all safe for work... if you're for some reason watching videos at
work.

- [Blue Moon Life](https://www.youtube.com/@BlueMoonLife), fellow 20-somethings
  in the PNW showing off the realities and complications of living aboard a
  small sailboat (a Catalina 30) while still holding down traditional
  non-remote day jobs.

- [Free Range Living](https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeRangeLiving),
  sailors-turned-homesteaders who circumnavigated Australia on an extremely
  simple, robust, and small sailboat (a Clansman 30), showing off the beauty of
  several Australian states' far-flung areas. This channel contains a seemingly
  unending treasure trove of boat maintenance and refit tips, without which my
  own work on _Cloudy Day_ would have been significantly more stressful.
  They've since sold _Mirool_ and moved ashore, caretaking a homestead in
  Western Australia.
    * Content Warnings: fishing, processing homestead animals

- [Sailing Uma](https://www.youtube.com/@SailingUma), architecture grads turned
  electric sailboat evangelists and world explorers (including taking an
  electric boat to Arctic Norway). Their later content includes a decent bit of
  sponsored stuff and generally takes a more cinematic turn, but the first ~2-3
  years of the channel especially are full of scrappy DIYing on a
  seemingly-tight budget

- [Simple Living Alaska](https://www.youtube.com/@SimpleLivingAlaska), lots of
  keep-it-fairly-simple, neo-rustic off-grid living and extensive gardening,
  preserving, and DIYing/self-sufficiency in south-central Alaska. They also
  serve as yet another data point in the "you can be in your 20s-30s and still
  do all this stuff" list.
    * Content Warnings: hunting, fishing, processing homestead animals, guns,
      heavy use of fossil fuels
