# Now

This is a living document, called a /now page, in the spirit of [Derek Sivers's
movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). Here you'll find an unordered and unranked
listing of, broadly, what I'm up to in life, and where my focuses are.

Well, I've completed my first of four months in Canada for this summer. Solar
panels are mounted, wired, and tested (and mostly keeping the batteries
net-neutral while at anchor: they don't recharge any uses of the motor yet,
because I simply don't generate enough power), all of my running rigging has
been replaced with slick new XTS3 lines, my old windlass has been removed, my
anchoring setup has gotten a decent bit of testing over the course of several
weeks (in winds up to about 30-something knots, so far), I survived a grueling
haulout where I removed and glassed in several thru-hulls that were no longer
needed (and relocated a seacock), and I've provisioned the boat to a decent
degree for "some?" amount of off-grid time (TBD). I've lost my dinghy to the
sea, and my mind as well along the way I think, but I'm here, and the summer
should offer some relaxation and beautiful sights to make up for it as I head
north into Desolation Sound over the coming weeks (via a pitstop in Nanaimo to
pick up my wind turbine and a few other odds and ends).

I've had a bit of time to hack on [Gale](https://github.com/klardotsh/gale)
here and there at anchor. It's a peaceful way to spend an evening. I'm not sure
how much of that I'll be doing this summer, though: I intend to spend many of
my summer evenings enjoying sunsets and laughs with friends, or maybe some
swims and hikes and rowing. But hey, a nerd and his screens eventually find
some time to meet back up...
