# Now

This is a living document, called a /now page, in the spirit of [Derek Sivers's
movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). Here you'll find an unordered and unranked
listing of, broadly, what I'm up to in life, and where my focuses are.

I am.

So.

Freakin'.

Busy.

And yet somehow so idle, particularly on anything that productively grows me as
a person or better aligns my future.

I guess there's not much to write, here, right now.
