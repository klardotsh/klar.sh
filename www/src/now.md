# Now

This is a living document, called a /now page, in the spirit of [Derek Sivers's
movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). Here you'll find an unordered and unranked
listing of, broadly, what I'm up to in life, and where my focuses are.

- Next week I start a new job, as the Senior Platform Engineer at
  [Forem](https://forem.com). I'm stoked to settle in and work on the
  infrastructure and internal tooling for a collection of sites that gets so
  much traffic, and to continue to work in the FOSS space as my day job (as had
  been a side dream of mine for a very long time, and Forem will make the
  second consecutive job where I'll have the opportunity to do so).

- I've now clocked in over 150 days without consuming alcohol, and a bit over
  two months without consuming caffeine (in anything more than the trace
  amounts found in decaf coffee). To the end of experimenting with better
  health, this seems to mostly be a success so far: I wake up usually more
  rested in the mornings (there's occasional exceptions), my energy levels are
  pretty stable throughout the day (at maybe 80% of their former, caffeinated,
  peak), and of course: no hangovers is always great. For the time being I have
  no imminent plans to return either substance to my body.

- Work on Gale (formerly `gluumy`) is largely paused for the upcoming future. I
  have plenty of ideas and even rough mental sketches of how to implement many
  of those ideas, but no real time to dedicate to it. I suspect it'll be summer
  or even into the autumn before I have appreciable time to pick this back up
  (or, indeed, any of my other hobbyist code work).

- FIRST volunteer season is in the home stretch: FTC season is in the books,
  and FRC season is, at time of writing, 1/4 events complete for me.

- The boat projects I had planned for the winter mostly didn't happen until
  closer to spring, where I'm now working on replacing the ceiling of the
  saloon (read: the core of the deck), installing foot pumps and new plumbing
  hosing in the galley and head, installing the composting toilet I've owned
  for ages and just never gotten around to installing (thank $DEITY for marina
  facilities this winter), and installing solar panels, charge controllers,
  etc! I have I relatively hard-stop date of May 14th, the absolute latest I
  can extend moorage here in Friday Harbor (at great cost: those 14 days of May
  would cost the same as a full month of winter moorage has, which ends April
  30th) - though ideally I'd be out on the hook sooner and will be doing
  everything I can to do so.

- I'm starting to think more deeply about my exact summer cruising plans.
  Tentatively, barring issues with customs or whatever, I'll be sailing through
  the Gulf Islands for a bit, and then up the Strait of Georgia and the east
  coast of Vancouver Island, with an eventual target of reaching Desolation
  Sound. Anything beyond that is bonus - friends and I have discussed the
  potential of places further north, but I'll have a lot of sailing practice to
  get in before that's feasible :)

- Other than that, I'm just generally winding "winter lazy" life down and
  prepping for summer, including properly unpacking remaining moving boxes and
  finding nooks and crannies to store my things on this boat.

- Hopefully I'll start finding time to update this page more often, and even
  get RSS wired up to it eventually...
