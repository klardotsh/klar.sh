# Now

This is a living document, called a /now page, in the spirit of [Derek Sivers's
movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). Here you'll find an unordered and unranked
listing of, broadly, what I'm up to in life, and where my focuses are.

Most recent update: `2022-11-20`

- I've recently moved aboard my boat, [Cloudy Day](/cloudy-day.html), which I
  purchased in summer 2021, and in summer 2022 gutted the electrical and
  plumbing systems and refit, rewired, and repowered the auxiliary (from diesel
  to electric). I now live, at least for the winter, in the San Juan Islands,
  and intend to live off-grid (exact locale TBD) at anchor during the warm and
  sunnier months. Almost all of this paragraph warrants callout links to
  dedicated pages, which I intend to write up over the coming weeks :)

- Related to the above, there are still several ongoing projects that didn't
  get done over the summer that I'm slowly getting through: re-plumbing various
  freshwater things (I've been using lots of reusable water jugs and bottles
  instead of the tanks on board), repairing/re-coring the ceiling/deck,
  waterproofing a few things, and planning out solar/wind power for the
  upcoming off-grid summer. I also need to rebuild the dinette area to be more
  desk-like: so far, my tech working environment has been only describable as
  "unergonomic", and I *do not* want to re-dabble in the world of RSI and/or
  early carpal tunnel.

- I got laid off in September as part of the general wave of tech layoffs and
  bubble-bursting (?), but started a new job in November which is, so far,
  seeming to be about as close to an ideal job as traditional employment can
  offer me. I'm excited to see how it shakes out, and whether it will, as I
  suspect it might, result in a less stressful and more balanced life.

- I've been dabbling with sobriety from alcohol. I'm not sure if it's a
  temporary or permanent change yet, but this is my second go-round of this
  type of change this year (a two-month stint over the summer, and now, at time
  of writing today, about a month on this stint), so something inside me is
  telling me something. Let's be real, anyway: hangovers in the second half of
  your 20's are way worse than they are in your late-teens and early 20's,
  which has a ton to do with it for me I think.

- FIRST Robotics season has started up, which has me in Seattle and its suburbs
  quite a bit lately, which I have complicated and sometimes-conflicting
  feelings about, but hey - I love the program, and I love refereeing and
  announcing robotics stuff, so for this season at least, I'll be staying the
  course. The degree of my involvement with the program in coming years is yet
  to be determined.
