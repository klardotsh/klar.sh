# Now

This is a living document, called a /now page, in the spirit of [Derek Sivers's
movement](https://sive.rs/nowff). Here you'll find an unordered and unranked
listing of, broadly, what I'm up to in life, and where my focuses are.

- By golly, I'm in Canada! I sailed over to Victoria, BC from Friday Harbor, WA
  (via Roche Harbor, WA - long story, I'll copy my writeup over from other
  socials to this site soonish) this past weekend, and now it's go time for
  prepping the boat for an off-grid summer at anchor up the BC coast. I'll be
  doing most of this list at the dock in Victoria, but a few things will wait
  for my brief haulout in Sidney, BC in early June. These projects include:
    * Mounting solar panels to the deck (at time of writing, they're now
      mounted, but not yet wired)
    * Replacing running rigging: these ropes are ANCIENT and feel terrible in
      the hand. Some of them are outright safety concerns.
    * Rigging a boom preventer
    * Sorting out anchoring gear and, as necessary, lines
    * Installing digital cockpit displays for NMEA data (depth, speed, wind,
      etc). These are Garmin GNX20's that draw extremely little power, I'm
      excited!
    * Installing new lights and (maybe?) a wind transducer up the mast
    * Installing the new radio and AIS transponder (I'll do a whole writeup on
      this eventually, because I want to elaborate for my fellow US boaters on
      things you'll need to accomodate and plan for if cruising to Canada)
    * Even more maybe: replace the terrible antenna on the mast and its
      cabling?
    * Galley and head faucet plumbing and flushing fresh water tanks of any
      gunk growing in them
    * Figuring out (or building) more food storage places, and loading up
      foodstuffs for a nice long summer away from civilization!
    * Discarding any remaining unused/unnecessary stuff. This will probably
      include various toolboxes and so forth that are currently a nightmare to
      store (they were fine when sedentary all winter, but I'm rapidly learning
      are horrible to stow and unstow for getting underway: repairing something
      at anchor would be brutal, and reclaiming space for food storage will
      become paramount)
    * Bottom paint, by far the most mundane and routine item on this list!
    * Possibly: installing the self-tailing winches I bought ages ago and are
      just sitting around. This may wait a bit: it could in theory be done at
      anchor later.

- In mid-April, I commentated the FIRST Robotics World Championship in Houston,
  TX. It was such a blast to see folks I often only see once a year (robot
  friends from all over the continent and world), and of course to meet up with
  many of my PNW pals yet again. If you want to find my commentary in the
  YouTube archives, I was the lead announcer for the FRC Daly Division field.

- I'm feeling pretty settled in at the new job; my coworkers are awesomely
  friendly people, the banter is good, and the work is very much up my alley at
  the intersection of ops, internal tooling, and proactive SRE-style work! The
  meetings load is light, too, which helps a ton for retaining sanity :)

That's about all I can write up today. Suffice to say, `NOW` is a very busy
time for me! I'll catch y'all later, and probably try to update this at the end
of the haul out when prepping to sail north!
