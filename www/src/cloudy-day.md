# Cloudy Day: a home for when the world turns gray

_Cloudy Day_ is a 1971 Challenger 32 masthead-sloop sailboat (which, because
counting is overrated, is actually about 33ft length overall), whose
sailor-nerd specs [can be found on
SailboatData](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/challenger-32). It is also, as
of fall 2022, my home.

I purchased Cloudy Day in Bellingham, WA in August of 2021 for about $10,000
USD[^1] in a Craigslist deal. At the time, she went by the name "Cara Mia",
evidently Italian for "My Beloved". After day-sailing her around Bellingham Bay
and surrounding waters through the rest of the 2021 season, she spent the
winter first in Blaine Harbor, and then later in Squalicum Harbor back in
Bellingham, largely unused while I tended to other matters in life.

The following summer (2022), I hauled the boat out for a rather extensive
electrical refit and a repowering of the auxiliary drivetrain, which I intend
to retroactively document here in the near future, replacing the Yanmar 3GM30F
diesel engine (I hate fossil fuels and fossil fuels hate us all) with a 10kW
48V electric motor and a 280AH LiFePO4 battery bank (48V, 16s). While doing
that work (and plenty more as it came up), I realized that for the first time
in my life, I had a space that was completely mine, and a space I could make as
cozy (or as rugged) as I wanted, with nobody to answer to but the sea. I never
*intended* to be a liveaboard: indeed, when I bought the boat, I explicitly was
looking for something "good enough for weekend or summer-holiday-week getaways,
maybe with some company sometimes" and not much more. But alas, I decided that
either the upcoming fall, or the following spring, I'd move aboard. Long
logistics-heavy story short, I wound up finding winter moorage in Friday
Harbor, WA for October 2022 to April 2023, and moved aboard full-time in late
October - leaks in the ceiling (from deck fittings) and all. It was around this
time that she was rechristened "Cloudy Day Real Estate"[^2], later shortened to
simply "Cloudy Day" for practicality purposes.

For personal life reasons, the winter of 2022-23 was relatively quiet as far as
boat projects went: I finally worked on replacing the saloon ceiling / deck
core, which had rotted away due to water intrusion and caused deck flex once
removed, I worked on the interior plumbing (including installation of a
composting toilet and replacing the old electric water pumps with foot pumps in
the head and galley), and finally installed solar panels.

Here, friends, is where I pause this page for a moment (as of March of 2023).
This summer I'll be sailing Cloudy Day around to some remote and quiet places
and finally getting a proper taste of the full-time liveaboard cruiser life,
and I'll try to find some time in that process to come back here and fill in
more of the history of this boat, and break out some sub-pages for individual
projects undertaken :)

[^2]: A pun if there ever was one: I'm a fan of the band [Sunny Day Real
    Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Day_Real_Estate), an emo band
    from the 90s here in the PNW, where it's exceptionally cloudy most of the
    year. The name also has a second meaning, alluded to in the title of this
    page: when all else goes to shit in the world, there's always the option of
    hopping aboard Cloudy Day and setting sail to other, possibly greener,
    pastures.
