# Cloudy Day: a home for when the world turns gray

_Cloudy Day_ is a 1971 Challenger 32 masthead-sloop sailboat (which,
ironically, is actually about 33ft length overall), whose sailor-nerd specs
[can be found on
SailboatData](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/challenger-32). It is also, as
of fall 2022, my home.

I purchased Cloudy Day in Bellingham, WA in August of 2021 for about $10,000
USD[^1] in a Craigslist deal. At the time, she went by the name "Cara Mia",
evidently Italian for "My Beloved". After day-sailing her around Bellingham Bay
and surrounding waters through the rest of the 2021 season, she spent the
winter first in Blaine Harbor, and then later in Squalicum Harbor back in
Bellingham, largely unused while I tended to other matters in life.

The following summer (2022), I hauled Cloudy Day out for a rather extensive
(underestimatedly so) and unfortunately-expensive electrical refit and a
repowering which I intend to retroactively document here in the near future,
replacing the Yanmar 3GM30F diesel engine (I hate fossil fuels and fossil fuels
hate us all) with a 10kW 48V electric motor and a 280AH LiFePO4 battery bank
(48V, 16s). While doing that work (and plenty more as it came up), I realized
that for the first time in my life, I had a space that was completely mine, and
a space I could make as cozy (or as rugged) as I wanted, with nobody to answer
to but the sea. I never *intended* to be a liveaboard: indeed, when I bought
Cloudy Day, I explicitly was looking for something "good enough for weekend or
summer-holiday-week getaways, maybe with some company sometimes" and not much
more. But alas, I decided that either the upcoming fall, or the following
spring, I'd move aboard. Long logistics-heavy story short, I wound up finding
winter moorage in Friday Harbor, WA for October 2022 to April 2023, and moved
aboard full-time in late October - leaks in the ceiling (from deck fittings)
and all :)

Here, friends, is where I pause this page for a moment - I'll come back and
fill in some of the alluded-to tangents and link-outs above over the winter,
and in the coming summer, I should have plenty of adventures to chronicle
aboard Cloudy Day to fill this page out more.
