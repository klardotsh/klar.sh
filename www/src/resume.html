<p>
My role here was some parts a developer, for example the maintenance and
evolution of the Forem Cloud SaaS offering's infrastructure, or the handling of
operational maintenance inherent to running a Rails app on Heroku, but was in
many more parts a mentor, tutor, and interface with an open-source development
community. I worked to make our infrastructure confidently and meaningfully
accessible by both any engineer at the company, and by external contributors to
Forem's repository.

My arrival marked the beginning of the eventually-3-person infrastructure team,
sitting at the middle of two product development teams and tasked with service
stability and developer experience. My role here was one part operational
maintenance and evolution of a long-standing Rails monolith on Heroku, one part
greenfield development of internal tooling, and one heaping helping of cross-
team mentorship on best practices for developing observable, debuggable, and
robust code.

After joining as a seed-round engineer and helping to build the launch product,

engineers, I oversaw and scaled both the public-facing multi-tenant application
and the internal customer success tooling, I established logging, metrics,
and observability practices, and I built developer tooling to build and deploy
applications faster and more securely.

&ldquo;I worked with Josh, but on a different team, and I got to reap the rewards of
Josh's stellar work - eg, an awesome and ever-improving DevXP. Josh is extremely
passionate, thoughtful, and smart, and it comes through in his work. I had great
interactions with him in the times that I got myself into a jam; he would help
unbreak my code, and, he'd teach me the "why" behind it, at a level that was
useful to me. I learned SO much from Josh when we worked together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beyond being extremely technically talented, Josh is just a genuine delight to
work with. He's interesting, kind, communicative, and puts great thought and
care into the work he does. I really hope I get the chance to work with Josh
again - whoever he works with next will be lucky to have him.&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;Josh is really easy to work with. Extremely knowledgeable and [...]
willing to say when he doesn't know something, [...] and also willing to do
the necessary research to fill in any gaps. He can be opinionated without being
abrasive or a stick-in-the-mud. He's helped manage and mentor several junior
developers who have grown tremendously under him and they have said in their
bi-annual reviews they love working with Josh, mirroring my own experience.
Personally speaking, every project I've worked on with Josh has gone smoothly:
he gets things done, doesn't get in anyone's way, and avoids "siloing" himself:
he has always kept the team apprised of what he's doing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Greatest strength: His deep system-level engineering skills, from
creating easy to use APIs, tracking their performance, and even deployment and
reliability engineering.&rdquo;
