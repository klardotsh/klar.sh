Hi! I'm Josh (generally known online as klardotsh[^1]), a software developer,
[liveaboard sailor](/cloudy-day.html), music enthusiast, competitive robotics
commentator and referee, and dweller and explorer of the Cascadia bioregion.
You may know of me from my work on the [KMK mechanical keyboard
firmware](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware), [the in-design gluumy
programming language](https://github.com/klardotsh/gluumy), [a tongue-in-cheek
software license](https://github.com/klardotsh/fork-off-public-license) that
went fungal[^2] on Mastodon, or for the robotics nerds in the house, from my
commentary work with [FIRST](https://firstinspires.org) and
[VEX](https://vexrobotics.com) in the Pacific Northwest.

[^1]: The username was originallly formed by sounding out this domain name in
    English, but the canonical pronounciation is "klar-dotshhhh". Exactly like
    you're shushing someone right after saying "dot".

[^2]: "Posts on [Mastodon] don't go viral, they go fungal, because the
    Fediverse is like the mycelium of mushrooms." -

I'm still building out this digital garden (it's winter, not much grows here
yet, but I'm working on it). In the meantime, over on <a rel="me"
href="https://merveilles.town/@klardotsh">my Mastodon</a>, you'll find short
utterances into the void in the meantime about boats, living on them, tech,
shouting at it, programming languages, designing them, and every so often
coffee, and how much of it is necessary to survive a PNW winter.

If you need to contact me, `josh` at this domain is a working email address. My
response times are generally measured in days to weeks, please be patient, but
I will get back to you.

Broadly speaking, I'm not currently accepting contract work, through the end of
2022, though I have plans in the works to that end in the new year.
