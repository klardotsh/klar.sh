# Howdy

You've reached the great abyss known as @klardotsh's website. Things are very
much under construction at the moment, sorry about that. Some day, likely after
I've attempted and failed to enact global peace, I'll have this page actually
fleshed out and looking useful. Probably. Maybe.

## Who am I? What's my deal?

I'm Josh. I write software and/or torment servers for a living and to some
extents as a hobby. I admire simplicity, modularity, entropy, whimsy, ethics,
empathy, and human-scale spaces and systems. I sail boats, I volunteer with
STEM education programs, I ride bikes, I occasionally dabble with music
production, and I am known to embrace the rain and gloom and scenery and coffee
of the Pacific Northwest. I am also known to shout my disdain for systems of
oppression, the state of modern computing (particularly its
privacy-disrespecting and hypercapitalist aspects), cars and the policies
written for them, and hot weather.

If you need to contact me, `josh` at this domain is a working email address, or
you can holler at me in more ephemeral form <a
href="//merveilles.town/@klardotsh">on Merveilles, a Mastodon community</a>.
