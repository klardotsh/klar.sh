# Howdy

You've reached the great abyss known as @klardotsh's website and digital
garden. Given that it's winter, not much grows here yet, but I'm working on it.

On <a rel="me" href="https://merveilles.town/@klardotsh">my Mastodon</a>,
you'll find short utterances into the void in the meantime about boats, living
on them, tech, shouting at it, programming languages, designing them, and every
so often coffee, and how much of it is necessary to survive a PNW winter.

If you need to contact me, `josh` at this domain is a working email address.
Generally, I'm not accepting contract work right now (or through the end of
2022), though I have plans in the works to that end in the new year perhaps.
