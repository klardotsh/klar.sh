# Living Thoughts

This is somewhat of a wiki section. On this page you'll find various small- to
medium-sized thoughts, which may change or even be removed at any time in the
future, that I haven't yet split out to their own pages (and may never bother!),
alongside links to longer-form thoughts that are liable to evolve over time (and
as such, aren't fit for a blog post which is written once and then, generally,
not modified later).

Everything on this page or any linked sub-pages should be considered fully
opinion. I may or may not choose to cite any references to back up claims made
on this page. If you want Actual Journalism Or A Hobbyist Equivalent Thereof,
check out my [blog](/articles.html), where you will still be disappointed, but
will find footnotes to extend my rambles into proper Thoughts.

## ... that were so long, they warranted their own page:

- [Audio Gear and "Audiophilia"](/living_thoughts/audio_gear_audiophilia.html)

## ... on the weather:

- Cold weather is better than hot weather, because I can always apply more
  layers to stay warm, but "allegedly" I "can't" walk around civilization naked to
  stay cool. Bit of a rip-off if you ask me.

- Rain brings life. Sure, getting caught in a downpour is no fun, but every time I
  drive through the desert or some other arid place, I make it about 5 days before
  wishing for greenery and life and vibrance that rain brings.

- ... except, if it's going to be hot anyway, I'd far rather it be dry than humid.
  35C in Las Vegas was tolerable. 35C in Los Angeles varied based on proximity to
  ocean breeze, but even inland was still tolerable. 35C in the Seattle area is
  universally unbearable: it's humid AF no matter where you go.

## ... on so many buzzwords they don't even fit in this heading:

The following buzzwords (or applications thereof) are all absolute bullshit.
Fuck you, personally, if you contribute to the overzealous hypermarketing of
these things to chase trends and/or in spite of a lack of supporting evidence
and/or in spite of evidence demonstrating their harms:

- Cryptocurrencies, [which consume about as much power as small
  nation-states](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)
- "NFTs", particularly those made of works made by folks other than those doing
  the selling
- Slapping an "AI" label on absolutely everything that uses an if-statement
  somewhere in the codebase
- ... or using AI to violate the rights and autonomy of artists
- ... or using AI to violate the rights and autonomy of software developers
- ... or using AI to violate the rights and wellbeing **of humans in general**
- There's more. Give me time to write them out eventually.
