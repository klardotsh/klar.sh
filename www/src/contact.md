- By email: `josh@klar.sh` or `josh@joshklar.com` are fine. Use `+fromwebsite`
  if you want the best odds of delivery, but it's not required. My response
  time for emails is typically measured in days to weeks in the winter, and
  almost always 1+ weeks in the summer unless it is clearly urgent.

- By IRC: `klardotsh` on `libera.chat` or `esper.net`, if I'm online. Typical
  for IRC, don't assume my scrollback or offline delivery works: if I see your
  message, I'll respond when I can, and otherwise, if it was important,
  probably send me an email follow-up shortly thereafter. If your inquiry can't
  fit within two or three IRC messages, it almost certainly needs to be an
  email instead.

- By marine VHF radio: I sail S/V [Cloudy Day](/cloudy-day.html) around the
  Salish Sea of Washington State and British Columbia; if you spot such a
  vessel in your AIS targets with a US-issued MMSI starting with `3682`, please
  feel free to call. If I'm not busy and I'm feeling social, I'll probably pick
  up :)

- If you want to hit me up on <a rel="me"
  href="//merveilles.town/@klardotsh">Mastodon</a>, go for it. Similar
  guidelines about message length apply as with IRC, but I tend to be decent
  about responding to short things within a couple days to a week on there.
